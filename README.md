# Undergraduate Research Project: Mobile Exercise Games

> Main goal: explore how mobile devices and applications can encourage children to exercise whilst making tasks fun and entertaining.

Our group developed a grocery game app prototype for iOS devices. It is meant to be used by children when they go grocery shopping with their parents. In summary, the parents use the app to make grocery lists; the kids play the game by walking through a grocery store looking for the items in the list and performing some simple physical exercises as requested.
